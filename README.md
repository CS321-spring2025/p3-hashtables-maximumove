## Overview

This program takes some set of objects and puts it into a HashTable that is wither using linear probing or double hashing. It then prints out the output and some additional information based on command line arguments.

## Reflection

Write a two paragraph reflection describing your experience with this 
project.  Talk about what worked well and what was challenging.  
Did you run into an issue that took some time to figure out?  
Tell us about it. What did you enjoy, what was less desirable? Feel
free to add other items (within the two paragraph limit).

This was an odd project to work on. It was not the new HashTable concepts that caused me strife, if anything it was actually pretty easy. It was the combination of other responsibilities and the driver classes output that gave me trouble. Partially because I did not realize the sh file was incomplete and because I had not used things like print writer in a while. Honestly the actually hash table concepts makes sense to me, and I am pretty happy about that.

Overall this was a fun project that I wish I had more time to work on. 

## Compiling and Using

To compile simply type 'Javac HashtableExperiment.java' into the console, and to run the tests list type './run-tests.sh'. For more custome running type java HashtableExperiment <datasource> <loadfactor> <debuglevel> (optional), where data source is an int between 1-3, load factor is a double between 0 and 1, and debug level is an integer from 0-2.
